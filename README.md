# MealPrepper
MealPrepper is a program that allows users to search for and filter through thousands of healthy meals that they can add to their own unique weekly meal plans while being able to track nutritional information and prices. 

MEALPREPPER IS NOT A COMPLETE PROJECT AND IS STILL IN THE WORKS

Features:
- Search menu where users can enter key words (names of foods) and find meal recipes that correspond
- Filter feature where users can find meals without specific foods
        - Great for users who have dietary restrictions and want to eat healthy and delicious meals
- Filter feature also allows users to input calorie and price ranges so that they can budget their expenses and eat healthy
- Implemented algorithm using Open AI's API
        - Seperate suggestion page based on the meals that the user has added to their meal plan
        - Suggestions are created based on a list of all the meals and outputs a variety of meals such as very similar to list, different to list and popular meals
- Uses Tkinter to create a modern and appealing UI theme

Next steps:
- Complete UI and connect to backend
- Add meal plan page where users can input their requirements (calories, budget, weight, age, sex)
